                by Carl Sandburg<br />
                Age level: 6-9</p>
              <p class="style1 ">A collection of whimsical stories full of wordplay,
                repetition and tongue-twisters,
                written by Pulitzer prize winning poet, Carl Sandburg. Originally
                published in
                1922, this classic is wonderful to read aloud, and is sure to
                capture children&rsquo;s

                by Fred Gwynne<br />
                Age level: 6 and up</p>
              <p class="style1">The main character in this picture book is a
                little girl who is confused by the homonyms -- words that sound
                alike but mean different things -- that she hears from her family.
                The
                author, Fred Gwynne, best known for his role as Herman on the
                television show,  &ldquo;The Munsters,&rdquo; has written two other books about homonyms as well. <strong><u>The

              <p class="style1">Told in rhyme, this story revolves around Ned,
                who, not knowing what to bring
                for &ldquo;show and tell,&rdquo; invents a contraption he calls
                a &ldquo;Word Mix-up Ray.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ned&rsquo;s invention
                turns objects and people into anagrams &ndash; Nat becomes an
                ant, a lamp 
                turns into a palm, Ned&rsquo;s own aunt turns into a tuna . After
                several escapades, Ned 
                finally rights most of his wrongs, and his adventures will surely
                inspire readers to
                try their own hands at wordplay.</p>

                1907 Nobel Prize for Literature, Rudyard
                Kipling&rsquo;s collection of classic stories has withstood the
                test of time. These twelve stories,
                often set in exotic locations, borrow from the tradition of Indian
                and African oral

                have a day like
                never before! The Amelia Bedelia series is wordplay at its funniest,
                and teaches
