                <td align="left" valign="top"><p class="style1 style2"><em><strong>Becky/WordGirl</strong></em><br />
                          Able to bend steel, fly at the speed of sound, and pause 
                          clocks long enough to prolong bedtime - WordGirl 
                          is actually mild-mannered 5th grader Becky Botsford 
                          in disguise! Becky left Planet Lexicon as an infant 
                          and arrived on Earth when her spaceship crash-landed. 
                          Her adopted parents, Jim and Sally Botsford, found her 
                          reading a newspaper on their front steps. By age 2, 
                          she was completing crossword puzzles and already knew 
                          every word in the dictionary (and most hieroglyphics, 
                          too). It is Becky's love of vocabulary that helps 
                          WordGirl save the day in her never-ending battle for 
                          truth, justice and use of the right word. She knows 
                          that crime doesn't pay, but knowing the right 
                          word for the right moment is priceless!</p>
                    <p class="style1"><em><strong>Captain Huggy Face</strong></em><br />
                          Captain Huggy Face is WordGirl's greatest ally! This 
                          brilliant monkey is also from Planet Lexicon (he was 
                          piloting WordGirl's spaceship when it crashed). Unlike 
                          WordGirl, Captain Huggy Face has no super powers. He 
                          has to put his superhero sidekick costume on one leg 
                          at a time, and often has to take the bus home when WordGirl 
                          forgets he can't fly. When he's not in costume, he is 
                          the Botsford family pet - but most people mistake him 
                          for a dog.</p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>Violet</strong></em><br />
                    Violet Heaslip is Becky's best friend in the whole
                    world. They met in Art Appreciation Class (after Becky failed
                    art class 3 times in a row). Where Becky lacks creativity,
                    Violet is an artistic genius (later in life she'll
                    win a Pulitzer Prize for poetry). Violet spends her time
                    daydreaming and lost in thought. Violet is kind and caring
                    and perhaps a little absentminded... like when she crosses
                    the street. She has a unique perspective on the world, which
                    might be why Becky gets along with her so well. </p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>Tim and Sally Botsford</strong></em><br />
                    Tim and Sally are Becky's adopted parents. Tim is always
                    supportive, even when he doesn't know what he's
                    being supportive about. Sally's lifelong ambition is
                    to be a guest on a game show - any game show. Unfortunately,
                    she isn't very good (she believes that Samuel L Jackson
                    was our 12th President.) (He wasn't; that was Zachary
                    Taylor. Samuel L. Jackson is an actor. Anyway... ) They
                    don't seem to notice that Becky and WordGirl are never
                    in the same place at the same time, or how they look exactly
                    alike.</p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>TJ</strong></em><br />
                    TJ is Becky's 7-year-old brother and the biological
                    son of Tim and Sally Botsford. He's super excited about
                    everything!!! TJ idolizes WordGirl. In fact, he's the
                    President and founding member of The Official WordGirl Fan
                    Club. Little does he know WordGirl is his sister, Becky.
                    TJ thinks the fact that WordGirl flies and lifts supertankers
                    is awesome!!! Becky constantly reminds him, "yeah,
                    but she's super smart, too!"  TJ answers, "Super
                    smart can't see through walls."  Becky just sighs.</p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>Todd "Scoops" Ming</strong></em><br />
                    Becky works with Scoops as a reporter on The Daily Rag, Public
                      School 131's school newspaper. Scoops desperately
                      wants to be an ace reporter, which explains his nickname.
                      He's a go-getter who knows there are a thousand stories
                      in the big city and he wants to be the first to report
                      them, especially the jackpot - uncovering the secret
                      identity of WordGirl. Becky has a secret crush on Scoops
                      and is somehow always able to get him an inside story on
                      WordGirl.</p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>Announcer</strong></em><br />
                    Like all announcers great and small, this one is heard but
                      not seen. He often joins in on the fun of WordGirl's
                      adventures. He comments on the action and sometimes teases
                      the characters. The Announcer's secret ambition is
                      to narrate the lead-in to 60 Minutes.</p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>Professor Two-Brains</strong></em><br />
                    Professor Two-Brains used to be the brilliant, kind-hearted
                      scientist Dr. Boxleitner before he accidentally fused his
                      brain with that of a lab rat. He battles with himself in
                      a Jeckel and Hyde kind of way, trying to contain his uncontrollable
                      urge to steal cheese and take over the city.</p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>The Butcher</strong></em><br />
                    The Butcher is a crook who "butchers" the English
                    language. He mangles words or makes them up altogether. As
                    a result, his cons are a complete debacle... or as he
                    would say, a dark buckle. He also has complete control over
                    all meat and most meat by-products. </p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>Tobey</strong></em><br />
                          Tobey is a 10-year-old boy genius who causes serious 
                          property damage in order to get WordGirl's attention, 
                          not that he'd ever admit it. He's a master of robotics, 
                          building giant robots to do his bidding. He's constantly 
                          trying to prove that he is WordGirl's intellectual superior. 
                        </p>
                  <p class="style1"><em><strong>Chuck the Evil Sandwich Guy</strong></em><br />
                          Chuck the Evil Sandwich Making Guy tried to use his 
                          sandwich making powers for good. He really did. Then 
                          he realized he was the only person who realized the 
                          awesome might of his sandwich making abilities. In fact, 
                          most people thought that having amazing sandwich making 
                          abilities was actually kind of silly. He decided that 
                          if people weren't going to realize his greatness on 
                          their own, he would force them to realize it. Chuck 
                          sometimes has a hard time coming up with the right word 
                          for the occasion, hence the name.</p>
                  		<p class="style1"><em><strong>Granny May</strong></em><br />
                          Granny May is a sweet old lady on the outside, but a 
                          mean, grumpy criminal on the inside. She plays the role 
                          of a feeble, kindly, hard-of-hearing grandma in order 
                          to deceive the city and rob everyone blind.<br />
                        </p>
						<p class="style1"><em><strong>Mr. Big<br />
                          </strong></em>Mr. Big is an evil businessman who loves 
                          to concoct schemes that involve using mind control to 
                          take over the city. He also loves squeezing really squishy 
                          things. I know...we think it's weird too.</p>
                        <p class="style1"><em><strong>Lady Redundant Woman<br />
                          </strong></em>When Beatrice Bixby, a disgruntled copy 
                          shop employee, pushes an unfamiliar button she merges 
                          with a photocopier and becomes the evil, the wicked, 
                          the villainous&#8212;Lady Redundant Woman! When she 
                          touches her nose she makes copies of herself and sends 
                          them out into the world to do her dastardly deeds. </p>
                        <p class="style1"><em><strong>The Whammer<br />
                          </strong></em>The Whammer began his villainous career 
                          attempting to be a sidekick for Chuck the Evil Sandwich 
                          Making Guy. The thing is&#8230; he&#8217;s not very 
                          good at being a sidekick- he really wants to be his 
                          own boss. When he whams his fists together he sends 
                          out a sonic wave that crushes whatever is in its path. 
                          Wham! He loves to wham things and when he whams them, 
                          he whams them good! Yeah! He thinks he is totally Whammer 
                          (whatever that means). WHAM! </p>
						<p class="style1"><em><strong>Energy Monster<br />
                          </strong></em>Born at the Energy Plant on the outskirts of 
						  town, the Energy Monster grows by absorbing energy from the 
						  city through power lines, movie theaters, and even your TV. 
						  He usually appears when WordGirl has something she'd much 
						  rather be doing than fighting crime, like celebrating her 
						  birthday, going to a movie premiere, or getting to school 
						  on time. He doesn't say much but this villain has a powerful 
						  ZAP that will make your hair stand on end.  </p>
						<p class="style1"><em><strong>Ms. Question<br />
                          </strong></em>Who is this woman?  What does she do? What's her 
						  superpower?  How did become a villain? In case you haven't 
						  guessed by now, everything she says is in the form of a question.  
						  Stayed tuned to see if WordGirl can get a straight answer</p>
						<p class="style1"><em><strong>Eileen a.k.a. The Birthday Girl<br />
                          </strong></em>When you first meet her, Eileen seems like an adorable 
						  little girl.  However, she thinks that every day is her birthday 
						  and that she deserves special treatment.  Her downfall is greed 
						  and she thinks that she should have anything and everything she 
						  wants. If someone dares to tell her no, she grows into a giant 
						  green monster shouting "Mine, Mine, MINE!" until she gets her way. 
						  She's been known to steal Bob (and dress him up), climb tall buildings, 
						  even try to make Violet her best friend.</p>
