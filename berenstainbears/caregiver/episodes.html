<b>1a Trouble At School</b><br>
Brother has been kept home from school for a few days with the flu and neglects to do the schoolwork that Sister delivered from his teacher. As a result, Brother&rsquo;s next math test mark is zero and he doesn&rsquo;t know how to break the bad news to Mama and Papa. He turns to Gramps and Gran for help and learns that getting a problem out in the open, goes a long way toward solving it.<br><br>

<b>1b Visit the Dentist</b><br>
When Sister gets her first loose tooth, Brother teases her that the dentist will extract it with a big yanking tool. After Sister watches Brother get a cavity filled, she discovers that her dentist is a very gentle fellow and he assures her that most baby teeth don&rsquo;t need yanking. They fall out all on their own. <br><br>

<b>2a Mighty Milton</b><br>
When a new cub at school is teased by Too-Tall and the gang for his lack of sporting ability, Brother takes it upon himself to help his new friend renew his self-esteem by finding value in the things he can do well.<br><br>


<b>2b Mama&rsquo;s New Job</b><br>
When Mama decides to open her own quilt shop, Papa and the cubs are convinced they won&rsquo;t be able to cope around the house without her. However it&rsquo;s only when they stop thinking about themselves and start thinking about supporting Mama and her new endeavour do Papa and the cubs band together to share the load and make it work.<br><br>

<b>3a Go To School</b><br> 
Too-Tall and the gang amuse themselves at Sister&rsquo;s expense by warning her how hard third grade will be and how strict Teacher Jane is. Brother tries unsuccessfully to convince Sis not to
 worry. Mama reminisces about Sister starting kindergarten and reflects on how her daughter&rsquo;s feelings back then were exactly the same. Sure enough, when Sister starts grade three she enjoys the new experience just like she did when she started kindergarten. <br><br>

<b>3b A Week at Grandma&rsquo;s</b><br>
When Mama and Papa go off on a second honeymoon, Brother and Sister are certain they&rsquo;re in for the most boring time of their lives spending an entire week with their grandparents. However the cubs&rsquo; preconception that old people are boring does a complete turnaround as they end up having an even better time than their parents - thanks to their anything but boring grandparents.<br><br>

<b>4a Trouble With Pets</b><br>
Brother and Sister adopt one of Farmer Ben&rsquo;s new puppies and soon discover that having a pet is a big responsibility. When the two pet owners leave to play with friends, the puppy stays behind and destroys the livingroom. As a result, the puppy is banished to the backyard. Brother and Sister apologise for neglecting their duties and Mama and Papa decide to give the cubs and the puppy a second chance. <br><br>

<b>4b The Sitter</b><br> 
Brother and Sister do some damage in Mrs. Grizzle&rsquo;s flowerbed while retrieving their baseball. Instead of stepping forward to apologize, the cubs get nervous and run home. As fate would have it, Mama arranges for Mrs. Grizzle to babysit the cubs that very night. Brother and Sister anticipate a very stern talking to, but are surprised by Mrs. Grizzle&rsquo;s kindhearted manner. <br> <br> 

<b>5a Too Much TV</b><br> 
When Mama puts a ban on television watching for one whole week, the cubs initially go into hysterics. As the week unfolds, Brother, Sister and Papa too, find that their interests extend well beyond the television set. They grow to realize just how
entertaining the great outdoors and other "simple" pleasures can be.<br> <br> 

<b>5b Trick or Treat</b><br> 
Brother and Sister plan to avoid Widder Jones&rsquo; house when they go trick or treating because neighbourhood lore has it that she&rsquo;s a witch. Mama knows Widder Jones personally and tells the cubs what a sweet person she is. When the evening is over the cubs agree with Mama. They enjoyed visiting Widder Jones more than anyone else that Halloween.  <br> <br> 

<b>6a Trouble With Money</b><br> 
When Mama and Papa refuse to buy Brother and Sister trendy overly expensive sport shirts, the cubs decide to earn the money themselves. However the cubs go overboard and get so caught up in everything from lemonade stands to dog walking services that they leave themselves no time for their friends. It&rsquo;s only when they
finally reach their goal that Brother and Sister realize the price tag has turned out to a lot bigger than they thought. Their blind pursuit of material things has cost them their friends.<br> <br> 

<b>6b Double Dare</b><br> 
Brother displays some real moxie when he attempts to get back Sister&rsquo;s skipping rope from Too-Tall and his mischievous gang. Too-Tall thinks Brother has what it takes to join his gang. After Brother becomes a member he&rsquo;s required to follow the leader...and that means trespassing on Farmer Ben&rsquo;s property to swipe watermelons. Brother is the only one caught and Farmer Ben has a heart to heart talk with him about how to deal with peer pressure.  <br> <br> 

<b>7a Out For the Team</b><br> 
Brother and Sister are good baseball players and both sign up to try out for the Bear Country Cardinals. The problem is, there&rsquo;s only one position left on the team. Worried about the humiliating  possibility of losing to his talented kid sister, Brother backs out of the competition. Sister has some encouraging words for
 Brother which inspire him to stick with it. The two cubs practice for the big tryout together.   <br> <br> 

<b>7b ACount Their Blessings</b><br> 
Brother and Sister often complain that their friends have more things than they do. Mama and Papa tell them they should be thankful for all the things they do have. When a big thunderstorm rages outside and the power goes out, the cubs are reminded of how fortunate they are to have loving parents and a cozy home to live in. It&rsquo;s a good time to count their blessings. <br> <br> 

<b>8a Slumber Party</b><br> 
Ensured by Sister that she knows the meaning of responsibility, Mama and Papa allow her to go to a sleep over at Lizzy&rsquo;s house. However Mama and Papa are totally unaware that the Bruins have gone out and left a babysitter in charge.  When practically every cub in town shows up at the party it gets so out of hand that when the Bruins return they call all the parents to come and take their cubs home. Although Mama and Papa agree that Sister is partially to blame, they also realize that if they had been a little more responsible themselves, they would have found out about the baby sitter early enough to nip it in the bud.<br> <br> 

<b>8b Homework Hassle</b><br> 
Brother complains that he&rsquo;s given too much homework and that&rsquo;s why he has fallen so far behind at school. Papa blames it on his highly distractive study environment and until Brother gets caught up, there&rsquo;ll be no television, video games, loud music or chatting on the phone. When Brother decides to do a little homework every night, he finds it&rsquo;s much easier to stay on top of his workload. <br> <br> 

<b>9a The Talent Show</b><br> 
Convinced that he doesn&rsquo;t have any talent to offer for the upcoming school talent show, Brother is recruited to be the talent scout. Guided by Teacher Bob&rsquo;s conviction that everyone has talent, Brother helps the other cubs discover their own
special talents, and in so doing, discovers he also has a talent just as Teacher Bob suspected - a talent for finding talent.<br> <br> 

<b>9b The Haunted Lighthouse</b><br> 
When the Bear Family vacations in an old lighthouse rendered obsolete by modern technology, they discover that it&rsquo;s rumoured to be haunted. Although the cubs encounter mysterious sights and sounds, they&rsquo;re anything but spooked. In fact Brother and Sister actively pursue the clues to the point where they not only reveal the &rsquo;ghost&rsquo; but come up with a way to give new life to the old lighthouse as well as the old lighthouse keeper.<br> <br> 

<b>10a The Birthday Boy</b><br> 
With Mama and Papa too busy setting up Brother&rsquo;s birthday party, Sister reluctantly decides to do her 'Tell Us About A Family Member' school assignment on Brother. However videotaping him for her project not only allows her to see a side of him she never saw before, it helps her realize just how much her big brother really means to her. Ultimately not only is Sister&rsquo;s Birthday Boy video an A+ project, it also doubles as Brother&rsquo;s best birthday
gift ever.<br> <br> 

<b>10b The Green Eyed Monster</b><br> 
When Brother gets a brand new three speed racer, Sister&rsquo;s envious feelings are personified in her dreams by a little green version of herself. This Green Eyed Monster convinces Sister to sneak Brother&rsquo;s new bike out for a ride but when she does, Sister realizes too late that it&rsquo;s too big for her and she can&rsquo;t control it. Fortunately Brother and Papa rescue Sister before Brother&rsquo;s bike can crash, then together they help chase the Green Eyed Monster away by jazzing up Brother&rsquo;s old bike and giving it to Sister.<br> <br> 

<b>11a The Baby Chipmunk</b><br> 
When she adopts a baby chipmunk, Sister learns the hard way about trying to keep a non-domestic animal as a house pet. As a baby all the chipmunk does is eat and sleep. However, the bigger it
grows the more active it gets and the more mess it makes and the
more trouble it causes. Of course none of it&rsquo;s intentional. That&rsquo;s just the creature&rsquo;s nature. But when it accidentally bites Papa, Sister finally realizes that if she really loves Little Brown Eyes, she&rsquo;ll do what&rsquo;s best for the chipmunk and return him to the outdoors where he belongs.<br> <br> 

<b>11b The Wishing Star</b><br> 
When Mama casually mentions the 'Star light, star bright' principle, Sister takes it to heart and wishes for a certain birthday gift and a better grade on her next math quiz. She gets both. However when the pony she wishes for doesn&rsquo;t materialize, Papa helps Sister understand that she really got her first two wishes all by herself - her special birthday gift because she&rsquo;d been so helpful around the house and the better math mark because she studied really hard for the quiz.  Bolstered by this, Sister makes her pony wish come true by making a deal with Farmer Ben to help him pick his peas in exchange for being allowed to spend time with his retired farm horse Princess. <br> <br> 

<b>12a Get the Gimmies</b><br> 
Brother and Sister think they&rsquo;re entitled to treats every time the family goes grocery shopping and Mama and Papa get tired of their Agimmie gimmie@ attitude. When Gramps and Gran drop by for a visit, they tell a touching story that inspires Brother and Sister to change their selfish ways and start thinking about others in need. <br> <br> 

<b>12b Lost in a Cave</b><br> 
When Papa leads the Bear Scouts on a spelunking expedition, it turns out Cousin Fred is afraid of dark, spooky caves. Through echos, fang toothed stalactites and creepy bats, the cubs help Fred realize there&rsquo;s a logical explanation for everything and what may seem scary at first, often turns out to be nothing to be afraid of at all. However when the pack find themselves suddenly lost, it&rsquo;s Fred&rsquo;s cool thinking that leads them out.<br> <br> 
 
<b>13a Too Much Junk Food</b><br> 
Papa and the cubs decide to train together for the Annual Bear Country Run, but find their performance level isn&rsquo;t increasing the way that it should. Dr. Grizzly informs them that exercise is important, but so is a healthy diet. When Papa and the cubs put away the junk food and eat more nutritious foods, their energy level is given the boost it needs to run the big race. <br> <br> 

<b>13b Go To Camp</b><br> 
The cubs have had a fantastic summer at day camp. When camp leader, Grizzly Ted, announces an end of summer sleep out at Skull Rock, everyone is excited...everyone except Sister. She&rsquo;s anxious about sleeping outside. With the help of her friend Lizzy, Sister has a trial camp out in her own backyard and is able to overcome her anxiety of sleeping under the stars. <br><br>

<b>14a Excuse Note</b><br> 
Sister sees the upside of having a twisted ankle when she presents the teacher with a note from home, excusing her from the rigors of gym class. She prolongs her convalescence as long as she can, but when Teacher Jane spots her running and playing at recess, her respite from gym class is over. Ultimately, Sister wants to get in shape for the soccer team tryouts and realizes the hard work of gym class will help her become the athlete she hopes to be.<br> <br> 

<b>14b On the Job</b><br> 
When Teacher Bob assigns his class a project on what they'd like to do when they grow up, everyone seems to know where their interests lie except Brother. After exploring Bear Country to see what types of jobs there are, Brother discovers he's interested in many things. Now his problem is deciding which one to include in his project. <br> <br> 

<b>15a Too Small For the Team</b>  (Based on the book title "The Soccer Tryouts")<br> 
Sister is keen on joining the school soccer team, but Coach Brown thinks she still has some growing to do before she's ready to compete with the bigger cubs. Sister grudgingly accepts the position of team manager instead. It's a tough job and Sister's perseverance doesn't go unnoticed by the coach, who ultimately invites her to play in a big soccer match.<br> <br> 

<b>15b The Jump Rope Contest</b><br> 
When Sister is picked to represent her school in the upcoming Jump Rope Contest, it goes to her head. All the adulation from her friends has Sister convinced she can't lose...that is until Lizzy helps her discover that her competition is just as skilled at rope jumping as she is, if not more so. Although all her boasting has set her up for a big fall, thanks to Mama and her friends, Sister learns that anyone who tries their best is a winner.<br> <br> 

<b>16a The Bad Habit</b><br> 
Sister develops a habit of nail-biting and various attempts to find a remedy are unsuccessful. When Brother notices a connection between Sister's math anxiety and her nail-biting, he offers his services as a tutor. Sister's fingernails start growing back when she no longer worries about how to add and subtract fractions. <br> <br> 
<b>16b The Prize Pumpkin</b><br> 
Papa's longstanding friendship with Farmer Ben becomes strained when winning first place at a pumpkin growing contest becomes far too important. On Thanksgiving Day, after his pumpkin fails to take the blue ribbon, Papa is thankful that Farmer Ben still wants to be his friend in spite his unneighbourly behavior during the competition.<br> <br> 

<b>17a Ferdy Factual</b>  (Based on the book title "The Nerdy Nephew")<br> 
When Brother promises to help a new kid get settled in at school, he's shocked to discover that Ferdy Factual is a stuck up know-it-all that corrects everyone including Teacher Bob. Although Brother tries harder than most to be Ferdy's friend, the pint size genius continues to snub him. Regardless, when he becomes the laughing stock of the school, Ferdy finally realizes who his real friends are. Not only does Brother go to Ferdy's defence, his example helps Ferdy understand that sometimes the best way to make friends is to be one. In return, Ferdy takes the opportunity Brother presents to him to make it up to everyone by using his smarts to help the school football team win an important victory.
<br> <br> 
<b>17b Lend a Helping Hand</b><br> 
En route to their friend's house, Brother and Sister stop to help the frail and elderly Widder Jones dispose of a fallen tree limb. The cubs soon wish they weren't so generous with their time when Mrs. Jones recruits them for other chores. While spending a Saturday cleaning out her attic, Brother and Sister come to enjoy the company of Widder Jones and find that lending a helping hand is a very rewarding experience.<br> <br> 
<b>18a The Big Blooper</b><br> 
While visiting her friend's house, Sister watches a video intended for a teenage audience. The movie contains some "colorful" language, which Sister innocently repeats at the Bears' dinner table. After Sister explains where she heard the offensive word, Mama tells her how their language has thousands of words to choose from, by picking words that show she respects the feelings of others, she'll be saying a lot about herself.<br> <br> 

<b>18b Nothing to Do </b><br> 
Mama finds Brother and Sister sad and grumpy because they have nothing to do. She suggests a number of entertaining things, but the cubs reject each one in turn. Not wanting them to suffer from boredom any longer, Mama finds jobs that need to be done around the house. All of a sudden the cubs have a change of heart; the entertaining things she suggested earlier now sound pretty good. However, seeing Mama and Papa working so hard compels Brother and Sister to roll up their sleeves and help with the work. <br> <br> 
 
<b>19a House of Mirrors</b><br> 
When something she overhears mistakenly leads Sister to believe she has 'big ears', nothing Mama can do will convince her otherwise. So instead Mama takes Sister to the carnival and to the House of Mirrors where their mirror images distort them in every way, shape and form imaginable - fat, thin, stretched, squished, until finally Sister finds herself staring at a mirror that makes her ears look truly elephantine. By comparison, Sister realizes that her ears are not big and that bears come in all shapes and sizes. The important thing is that our inner goodness speaks to who we are much more than our outward appearance does.<br> <br> 

<b>19b Too Much Pressure</b><br> 
Between Brother's baseball, soccer and karate, Sister's gymnastics, art and swimming, Mama's quilting club and PTA and Papa's furniture orders and town council reforestation committee, the Bear Family can hardly squeeze in a visit to Gran and Gramps'. Devising a huge schedule board to try to keep track of who's coming and who's going where and when, they're surprised to discover it's completely filled. Ultimately things come to a head as Mama finds herself in a situation where she and the cubs are supposed to be in three places at once. At the same time, the car breaks down...and so does Mama. Realizing that they just have too much pressure, the Bear Family decide to cut down on the number of their activities. That way, with the pressure off, they all now have the time to truly enjoy the things they do.<br> <br> 

<b>20a Visit Fun Park </b><br> 
A ream of free ride tickets given to Mama at the supermarket prompts the Bear family to go to the amusement park. Brother boasts to friends and family that he'll fearlessly ride the legendary Thunderbolt roller coaster. However, when Brother sees how scary the ride actually is, he spends the rest of his day desperately trying to avoid it. The moment of reckoning for his boastful behavior comes as Brother is about to board the dreaded ride and backs out at the last moment. <br> <br> 

<b>20b The Perfect Fishing Spot</b><br> 
Deciding that they're going to make Gran and Gramps' anniversary dinner special, Papa sets out to catch a prize winning fish as the main course and Mama sets out to make one of her blue ribbon pies for dessert. However one thing after the other gets in their way to the point they find themselves with no fish, no pie and no time.  Ultimately it's the cubs who help Mama and Papa realize that it's not what's on the table but who comes to it that makes a dinner special.<br> <br> 

<b>21a The Summer Job</b><br> 
Brother and Sister are given the opportunity to learn about farming when they spend their summer working with Farmer Ben. They experience the joys and sorrows of working in a field so intrinsically linked to the whims of Mother Nature. As the summer ends the cubs harvest their own crop of sweet corn and gain a new appreciation for the effort that goes into farming.  <br> <br> 

<b>21b The Big Red Kite</b><br> 
When a store window full of colourful novelty kites gets the cubs excited about entering a kite-flying contest, Brother and Sister are surprised when Papa suggests they build their own kite instead of buying one. Together Papa and the cubs build a big old style kite, which turns out to be too big to fly without an equally big wind. Regardless, instead of buying a store bought kite for the contest like all the other cubs, Brother and Sister decide to take their chances on 'Big Red'. To them, it's no longer about winning or losing; it's about taking pride in something they've made. They just want to see Big Red fly. As luck would have it, the wind picks up and, as all the store bought kites crash to the ground, Big Red flies so high, all the contestants join in and have a great time flying it.<br> <br> 

<b> 22a Too Much Vacation</b><br> 
From the moment the Bear Family arrives at their mountain cabin, Papa's promise of 'the best vacation ever' begins going down hill like an alpine avalanche. Not only is the cabin a shack, but also the lake has more weeds than the Sargasso Sea and the only thing biting are the mosquitoes. It becomes increasingly difficult for Papa to keep a smile on his face as he slips down muddy slopes, breaks through the bottom of the rotten rowboat and is chased by little forest critters. Ultimately it rains so much, the run off floods them out and carries a sleeping Papa out to the middle of the lake on his mattress. That's the last straw. Papa's best vacation ever has turned out to be the worst vacation ever. It's only when the cubs show Papa the snapshots they've been taking of him and the so called calamities that he finally realizes how much fun they've been having all along because having fun is just a matter of attitude.<br> <br> 

<b>22b Trouble With Grown Ups</b><br> 
In order to convey that it's tough being a cub, Brother and Sister put on a play, which comically depicts their parents as overbearing tyrants. The cubs are pleased when Mama and Papa agree they see the cubs' point. However when Mama and Papa offer to switch places with Brother and Sister and let them be the parents, the cubs readily agree. It's only after the cubs realize they're responsible for doing the dishing, making the meals and keeping the house in order that they come to the conclusion, and see Mama and Papa's point, that sometimes it's just as tough being a parent as it is being a cub.<br> <br> 

<b>23a Go To The Doctor</b> <br> 
The cubs' younger cousin, Honey is apprehensive about going to the doctor's office for a checkup. Sister dispels Honey's fear of the unknown by setting up a pretend doctor's office and taking Honey through all the procedures of a checkup, using the instruments in her toy doctor's bag.<br> <br> 
 
<b>23b Don't Pollute (Anymore)</b><br> 
Looking for something to do their environmental school project on, Brother and Sister visit Professor Actual Factual at the Bearsonian Institute. Not only do they discover that too much trash in Bear Country is a big problem, they also learn about endangered species such as the Bumbleberry tree - one of which Papa is intending to cut down to make a very special table. By showing them how to recycle eggshells as plant fertilizer, Mama helps the cubs discover that even little cubs like them can help reduce waste. Not only do the cubs spread the word to their friends who come up with their own ways to recycle, they help Papa realize he should help the environment by planting new trees instead of cutting them down.<br> <br> 

<b>24a The In Crowd</b><br> 
When a snooty new girl with a snazzy new mountain bike and all the latest fashions moves into town, Sister finds herself torn between practising for the upcoming Double-Dutch contest and trying to fit in with the new girl's In-Crowd. Sister finally decides to hang up her beloved skipping rope and starts dressing and acting like the others. However, although her new clothes help Sister fit in with the In-Crowd, seeing herself in them makes her realize that she's trying to be something she's not and she decides, once and for all, that she likes her pink jumper, she likes her hair ribbon, she likes her Double-Dutch and most of all, she likes herself just the way she is.<br> <br> 

<b>24b Fly It </b><br> 
Brother and Freddy team up to try and create an innovative flying device for their fifth grade science project. Their hopes are dashed after a series of unsuccessful test flights and they decide to give up on the whole notion of being inventors. After having a talk with veteran inventor, Professor Actual Factual, the two cubs are encouraged to keep trying and ultimately they succeed in making a balloon-propelled aircraft that impresses the entire class. <br> <br> 

<b>25a By The Sea</b><br> 
When the Bear family arrives at their vacation beach house, the cubs balk at spending any time unpacking and cleaning. They want to go swimming immediately. Seeing the opportunity to teach the cubs a lesson about family cooperation, Mama and Papa decide to join the cubs on the beach. When the cubs realize their swimsuits are hopelessly buried somewhere in the trunk of the car, they become more willing to help their parents.<br> <br> 

<b>25b Catch The Bus</b><br>
