              Big Idea: </font>Have Respect</h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p><b>Objective:</b><br>        It's important for children to respect the dreams and ideas of others.  Helping children to understand this kind of respect can lead them to believe in themselves and fulfill their own dreams, whatever they might be!  The following activities nurture:</p>        <ul>          <li>social and emotional skills</li>          <li>reading and language</li><li>physical and motor skills</li>     </ul>      </blockquote>

              <font color="#FF6600">Maybe I'll Be a Dentist!</font></h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p>Materials: toothbrush, toothpaste, floss, mouthwash
</p><p>
Discuss what a dentist does, what tools a dentist uses, and why it's important to take proper care of our teeth.  Then teach your child these three important steps that promote good dental care for healthy teeth and gums:
<ol>
<li> Brush with a toothbrush and toothpaste, floss, swish and rinse.</li>
<li> Eat healthy foods, not too much sugar!</li>
<li> Visit the dentist regularly.</li>
</ol>
Use the basic teeth cleaning items to demonstrate proper uses for each item.  Then let your child practice using some new "cleaning tools" like floss and mouthwash.

   
<p></p>        <p><b>With a Group:</b> <br>            Schedule a visit to a local dentist office.  Many dentists give out samples and are happy to share their expertise on dental procedures and preventative care. Perhaps an orthodontist would be a good choice of dentist since many children wear braces.</p>      </blockquote>

Materials: Basic fire safety rules from your local fire station
</p><p>
Share with your child that a person that tends to the medical needs of an animal is called a veterinarian.  Some veterinarians take care of large animals like cattle, horses and zoo animals.  Then there are others that take care of small animals like dogs, cats, gerbils, etc.  Introduce your child to your local veterinarian.  If you have a pet, schedule a check up time and let your child observe the doctor for a firsthand look at what he does to keep your pet healthy.  Ask your veterinarian to talk about the many career opportunities in his field.


</p>     <!--[[p]][[b]]With a Group:[[/b]] [[br]]            Invite children to choose a partner to share "snack time" snacks with, set the timer and go!  When the activity is finished, transition to a quieter activity by using the timer to play the "Quiet Game" or "I Spy."[[/p]]-->      </blockquote>
