              (Episode P110a)</font></h3>

            <p>Norville is left feeling sad and lonely when it seems as though 

              he is the only one without a tradition for celebrating the first 

              snowfall of the year. It's up to Clifford and his friends to find 

              a way to help Norville feel included.</p>

              Ideas to Grow On: </font>Be Kind & Share   </h3>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Objective:<br>

          </b>When children are kind, this means that they connect with the feelings of others.  By giving children opportunities to show acts of kindness, they learn powerful lessons for a healthy social and emotional foundation.  The following activities nurture:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>social and emotional skills</li>

          <li>language and literacy skills</li>

		  <li>physical and motor skills</li>

        </ul>

            <blockquote> 

              <p> Help your child share some winter kindness by creating these 

                three yummy treats made especially for feathered friends:</p>

				<ul>

				<li>Orange Cup - Cut orange in half.  Squeeze juice out to enjoy while making the feeder.  Remove pulp with spoon.  Punch several holes around each orange's edge.  Lace 6 inches of string through each hole, tying knot at top.  Fill with birdseed and "hang around" to see what happens!

				<li>Pop'n Treats - String popcorn and toss it up into a tree or place it near a window so you can watch your feathered friends enjoy this delicious treat.  Don't forget to save yourself some popcorn...it's not just for the birds! 

				<li>Nutty Roll - Punch a hole through the top of empty toilet 

                  tissue roll to lace string, yarn, or light wire through for 

                  hanging. Spread peanut butter on the outside of the tube and 

                  roll in birdseed. Hang outside and watch who shows up!

              </ul>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>Snowy days, inside and outside, can be wonderful!  Use these fun ideas to make the most of your child's opportunity to enjoy this miracle of nature:</p>

		<ul>

		<li>Cuddle up with a cup of hot chocolate and read <i>The Snowy Day</i> by Ezra Jack Keats (Scholastic Big Books).

<li>Dip paintbrush in watercolors and paint the snow! 

<li>Make snow drinks by pouring juice over a cup full of clean snow.

<li>Make snow ice cream by adding a few tablespoons of milk and vanilla extract to snow.  Top with some chocolate syrup and a cherry.

<li>Make a "Mitten Match" game by cutting out different shapes/colors of mittens to pair up in timed game.

<li>Get physical by having scavenger hunts and listening walks.  Take notice to discover how pets and animals around your home spend their winter days.
