              (Episode 216b)</font></h3>
            <p>After reading the book <i>Treasure Island</i> in school, the kids decide to throw a "Treasure Island" theme party.  Clifford helps prepare for the festivities on Charley's houseboat.  But once the party begins, Clifford's friends discover that he is too big to fit on the boat.  The kids choose to move the party to another location rather than let Clifford feel left out and miss all the fun.</p>

            <blockquote>        <p><b>Objective:</b><br>        It's always nice when friends work together.  By learning to respect other's feelings and unique characteristics, children can better develop important skills needed to positively interact within a diverse society.  These following activities nurture:</p>        <ul>          <li>social and emotional skills</li>          <li>creative expression</li> <li>physical and motor skills</li>  </ul>      </blockquote>

              <font color="#FF6600">Who Are You?</font></h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p>Materials: paper and pencils
</p><p>
We typically answer the question, "Who are you?" by stating our name.  That's how we identify each other.  But truthfully, our names are just a small part of ourselves.  
</p><p>
Is it that freckle-dotted nose, the ability to climb like a monkey, a sweet voice when songs are sung, or perhaps the love for reading a favorite book that makes your child so special?  Express what you love about his/her physical and emotional characteristics.  Then encourage your child to do the same about you.  Discovering the mutual admiration that you and your child share for one another will be special indeed!


</p>        <!--[[p]][[b]]With a Group:[[/b]] [[br]]   Children can become better problem solvers when they have opportunities to role-play.  Pair up children into animal "teams" listed above.  Brainstorm why or why not these team members might be a threat to each other.[[/p]] -->     </blockquote>

            <blockquote>   <p>Materials: individual pictures of moon/sun, roller skate/pogo stick, Ping-Pong paddle/Ping-Pong ball, mountain/valley, summer/winter, president/secretary, cow/calf, dolphin/shark, etc., markers or crayons
</p><p>
Hold up the picture of the moon and the sun.  Have your child choose which picture best describes him/her and discuss why.  Then let your child choose which picture best describes you.  It's a most fun way to communicate feelings and thoughts about one another.  

 
 </p>     <!--[[p]][[b]]With a Group:[[/b]] [[br]]     Take your child on a journey to the zoo to discover how animals live with their own kind and among other species in harmony.  Encourage your child to take pictures.  Then use the pictures to create a pictorial diary or book of memories.  Discuss valuable lessons that are observed in the animal habitat.  Animals have a lot to teach us humans[[/p]]-->      </blockquote>

<p>Materials: inkpad, drawing paper or recent picture of child, pencil
</p><p>
Just as no two snowflakes are the same, our fingerprints are also unique and unlike any one else's…it's amazing!  Help your child discover this phenomenon by making a personal set of fingerprints to study and compare.  
</p><p>
Model how to make fingerprints for your child by placing your prints on a recent picture of yourself or on your own simple self-portrait.  Then carefully guide your child through the same steps.  Take time to compare the prints and talk about how special and unique everyone really is as you work together to make these one-of-a-kind keepsakes!
