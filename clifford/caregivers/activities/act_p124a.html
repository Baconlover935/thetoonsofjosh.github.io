            <p>Inspired by a classroom visit by Ken Burns, Emily Elizabeth, Nina and Shun try to make a documentary highlighting people in their neighborhood. But they're so busy trying to do their jobs that they don't realize how they're messing up their interviews. After they learn a lesson from Clifford about having respect for others, they make a successful documentary.</p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Objective:<br>

          </b>Showing respect for others is something that children learn by experience.  It's important to give children opportunities to share their knowledge and show their respect for others.  The following activities nurture: </p>

        <ul>

          <li>life skills</li>

          <li>cognitive skills</li>

		  <li>critical thinking and problem solving skills</li>

        </ul>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>Make an episode connection by assisting your child in creating a personal documentary to share with family and friends.  Start by planning how your child will interact with favorite people and pets.  Don't forget to show your child enjoying favorite activities like playing, reading, cooking, or watching Clifford the Big Red Dog cartoons!  Whether by camera or video, this will be a keepsake.</p>

        <p>Help your child document knowledge about home fire safety with a video, camera, or tape recorder.  Follow these ideas to assist in organizing and presenting information:  </p>

		      <ul>

                <li>Visit local fire department  

                <li>Gather printed information about fire safety  

				<li>Ask professional firefighter to demonstrate daily routine and fire fighting techniques. 

				<li>Prepare list of emergency numbers to share with audience.
				
				<li>Interview friends, family, and neighbors that have been involved in a fire or had experience with fire accident in the home.
				
				<li>Demonstrate how to "stop, drop, and roll."  Also lead audience through escape routes in the home.  Point out water sources and items in the home that could be used to smother a fire.
              </ul>
		<p>Finally, share this "Safety First" documentary with special people and be proud of your efforts to bring more awareness to a serious issue that could save lives!</p>
