              Big Idea: </font>Be a Good Friend</h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p><b>Objective:</b><br>        By understanding that circumstances sometimes change our best-made plans, children can be more relaxed and open to new ideas.  Appreciating that anytime can be a fun time when it's spent with a friend can help children have an easier time adjusting to unpredictable situations.  The following activities nurture: </p>        <ul>          <li>reading and language</li>          <li>creative expression</li>  </ul>      </blockquote>

              <font color="#FF6600">Popsicle Pictures</font></h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p>Materials: various animal costumes, masks or nametags to indicate animal characters: cat/dog, cat/bird, baby seal/shark, fox/chicken, snake/mouse, lizard/fly, etc.
</p><p>
Materials: Ice cube tray, water, washable finger paint
</p><p>
Have your child invite over a friend to make these fun paint sticks.  Fill ice cube trays with a mixture of water/food coloring or water/tempera paint.  Place in freezer.  When the mixture begins to set, put a Popsicle stick in each cube.  Let freeze.  Each cube becomes an artist's paintbrush!  Paint on the sidewalk, butcher paper, paper bag, etc.  This is a really "cool" and washable painting project!  



</p>        <!--[[p]][[b]]With a Group:[[/b]] [[br]]   Children can become better problem solvers when they have opportunities to role-play.  Pair up children into animal "teams" listed above.  Brainstorm why or why not these team members might be a threat to each other.[[/p]]-->      </blockquote>

            <blockquote>   <p>Materials: pots, pan, utensils without sharp edges
</p><p>
Share with your child and a friend, pictures of primitive instruments.  Discover kitchen items right in your own kitchen that make musical sounds.  Encourage your child and his/her friend to beat a soulful rhythm for a clinking-clanking fun time!

 
 </p>    <!-- [[p]][[b]]With a Group:[[/b]] [[br]]     Take your child on a journey to the zoo to discover how animals live with their own kind and among other species in harmony.  Encourage your child to take pictures.  Then use the pictures to create a pictorial diary or book of memories.  Discuss valuable lessons that are observed in the animal habitat.  Animals have a lot to teach us humans[[/p]]-->      </blockquote>

            <blockquote>       
<p>Materials: Old letters, packages, newspapers, post cards- anything a postal worker could sort!
</p><p>
Take your child and a friend to your local post office and introduce them to the world of mail pick-up, sorting and delivery.  Ask to see the newest collectable stamps, use the mail drop and discover what a passport is.    
</p><p>
To extend the post office tour at home, prepare envelopes addressed with numbers, letters, words, colors, or symbols.  Label places in the house/yard to correspond with envelope addresses.  Use this opportunity to teach math and reading concepts.  Sort the mail, pack it in a bag and send out your "letter carrier/carriers" to run the route.  After the mail has been delivered, take time out for a quick break.  Then send out your "letter carrier/carriers" back out to pick up the mail for return to the post office…it's all in a day's work.
