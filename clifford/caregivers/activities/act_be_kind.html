            <p>It's Emily Elizabeth's birthday and she only wishes for one thing--a 
              puppy from Mr. Bradley's litter. Emily Elizabeth can't resist Clifford, 
              the runt of the litter. He's so small that he can't reach his water 
              bowl -- and he's just the right size to sleep in Mr. Howard's slipper. 
              But soon, Emily Elizabeth's little dog grows so big that the Howard 
              family has to move to a bigger house!</p>

              Big Idea: </font>Be Kind</h3>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Objective:<br>
          </b>Kindness is one of the most fulfilling qualities that anyone can possess. Being kind requires a connection with someone else's feelings. By involving children in acts of kindness, you can help them 
better understand generosity and empathy for others. The following activities nurture: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> social and emotional skills</li>
		   <li> life skills</li>
          <li> critical thinking and problem solving skills</li>
        </ul>

      <blockquote> 
        <p>Paint a glass or plastic jar with designs of hearts, balloons, etc.  Cut a slit in the lid.  As your child performs acts of kindness, record each one on a piece of brightly colored paper and slip it in the jar.  Set a goal for a fun reward like a movie, playtime at the park, or overnight company for reaching a goal or number of goals.  Take time to read acts of kindness again to remember how good it felt to do something kind for someone else.</p>

      <blockquote> 
              <p>Help your child brainstorm ways that family and friends could be surprised with acts of kindness.  Encourage your child's enthusiasm for showing kindness to others by using these ideas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Share a smile by arranging a bouquet of wild flowers for someone who's sick.</li>
          <li>Show support by sharing something sweet with someone needing encouragement. </li>
          <li>Express appreciation by giving time to someone who's lonely.</li>
		   <li>Be helpful by doing a chore for someone who's less able.</li>
		   <li>Spread laughter by telling silly jokes to someone who needs cheering up.</li>
        </ul>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>With a Group: </b><br>
          Help children create a group mission statement. A mission statement simply states a goal and reason for achieving that goal. It could be as simple as contributing 30 minutes a week to helping a neighborhood project for the good of the community or spending time with someone elderly to show concern for a Senior Citizen. As missions are completed, award certificates of appreciation to celebrate Mission Appreciation! </p>
