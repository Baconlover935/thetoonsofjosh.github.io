              215a)</font></h3>
            <p>When Emily Elizabeth puts off the responsibility of cleaning her room, the mess grows until she can't find anything.  She spends so much time trying to find things that she misses out on fun activities like reading to Clifford and playing with her friends.  She soon learns that taking care of responsibility now can save a lot of trouble later.</p>

            <blockquote>        <p><b>Objective:</b><br>        Becoming a responsible person takes time and practice!  Through daily life experiences, children can benefit from valuable opportunities to understand the benefits of being responsible.  The following activities nurture: </p>        <ul>          <li>math and numbers</li>          <li>physical and motor skills</li>  <li>social and emotional skills</li>   </ul>      </blockquote>

            <blockquote>        <p>Materials: Pictures of seasonal clothing, 4 paper plates, glue, scissors
</p><p>
Write the name of each season on each one of the plates. Discuss with your child the different types of clothing that one might wear during each season of the year.  Have your child cut out pictures of clothing and accessories for spring, summer, winter and fall.  Categorize the pictures and accessories according to their season.  Then glue the pictures of clothing and accessories on their respective season plate




</p>        <p><b>With a Group:</b> <br>    Engage children in a fun game of seasonal dress up.  The goal is to guess the season that each child has dressed for.  To make it really fun, have a few children mix seasonal dress.  Then wait for someone to catch the mismatched outfits and tell why they are inappropriate for the season.</p>      </blockquote>

            <blockquote>   <p>
Materials: Messy room, two laundry baskets
</p><p>
Emily Elizabeth didn't like cleaning her room because it wasn't any fun.  Help your child play this silly game to ease the room cleaning doldrums!  Play your child's favorite music and let the fun begin.  Set two laundry baskets in the middle of the room.  Sort clothes into categories of colors/whites, clean/dirty by taking turns tossing each piece of clothing into the appropriate basket.  It's painless and a groovy way to clean!

Arrange for your local bird watching expert to take your group on a birding adventure in the park or zoo.  Encourage children to keep a journal with illustrations to share later.[[/p]]      --></blockquote>
