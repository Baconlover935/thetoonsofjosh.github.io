            <p>Evan gets tickets to see his hero, Allan Houston, play basketball, and he's really excited. Emily Elizabeth and Clifford come along, and they strike up a friendship with Allan Houston's daughter, Remie, and her beagle puppy, Hoops. Evan winds up babysitting for Remie and Hoops during the game. He's happy to do it, but he winds up missing most of the game. But he's a good sport about it, and when Allan Houston makes it up to him by playing some one-on-one basketball with him - it's his dream come true!</p>

          </b>Children are born helpers!  By sharing opportunities to serve and help others, children learn valuable lessons that foster social and emotional growth..  The following activities nurture: </p>

        <ul>

          <li>social and emotional skills</li>

          <li>life skills</li>

		  <li>language and literacy skills</li>

      <blockquote> 

              <p>Read <i>Clifford, We Love You</i> by Norman Bridwell (Scholastic). 
                Discuss how Emily Elizabeth showed respect and love for her best 
                friend, Clifford. Then help your child list more ways that friends 
                show others friends how much they are respected and loved by one 
                another. Assist your child in writing letters to friends that 
                express how much they are appreciated. Place confetti, a coupon 
                for a movie together, or a piece of stick gum in with the letter 
                for an added friendly surprise</p>
