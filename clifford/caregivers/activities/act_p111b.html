            <p>Norville is molting, and he is so embarrassed by the way he looks 

              that he refuses to let his friends see him. How will Norville's 

              friends help him see that they like him for who he is, not what 

              he looks like?</p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p><b>Objective:<br>

                </b>Being a good friend means accepting the uniqueness of someone 

                different. Children grow in their understanding of diversity, 

                not only within the human race, but also in nature by social interaction 

                and exploration of their surroundings, or environment. The following 

                activities nurture: </p>

        <ul>

          <li>understanding and appreciating diversity skills

<li>science and discovery skills

<li>art appreciation skills 



        </ul>

            <blockquote> 

              <p> Introduce your child to the word &quot;ornithology.&quot; Explain 

                that this word refers to the structure, habits, etc. of birds. 

                An &quot;ornithologist&quot; is someone very knowledgeable about 

                birds. Share these interesting facts about birds:</p>

				<ul>

				<li>A bird is a natural flying machine! It takes off, soars, dives, and lands without any help!

<li>A bird's heart beats faster than any other animal.

<li>A bird's body temperature is higher than mans'.

<li>All birds have wings, but not all birds fly.

<li>Birds lay eggs.

<li>All birds have feathers, beaks, 2 legs, 2 wings, and claws on their toes.

<li>The largest flying bird is the Great Bustard, weighing 32 pounds!

<li>Some birds have bones that weigh less than their feathers.

<li>When old feathers wear out, new feathers grow in...this is called "molting."

<li>We see birds as symbols: Owl for wisdom, Dove for peace, and an Eagle for freedom!

      <blockquote> 
	<p><b>With a Group:</b><br>
        <p>Work together to make a bird mural!  With binoculars in hand, take young ornithologists on a nature walk to discover the sights and sounds of local birds!  Gather small, light objects like twigs, grass, fallen feathers, acorns, etc.  Afterwards, cut out magazine pictures or color pictures of birds.  Glue to a 3-6 ft. piece of paper.  Help children write the above interesting facts about birds on their mural.  Then glue gathered objects to add dimension and natural detail!</p>
