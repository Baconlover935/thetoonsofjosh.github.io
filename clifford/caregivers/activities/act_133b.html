      <p>When Jetta gets a new baby brother, she is extremely proud to be a big 
        sister&#151;at first&#151;but when she realizes that she will now have to share 
        the spotlight with the baby, she goes all out to regain her position as 
        the center of attention. She eventually learns, however, that being a 
        good "big sister" is far more rewarding than being the "star of the show."</p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Objective:<br>
          </b>The fact that families come in all shapes, sizes, and forms is important 
          to understand at an early age. Although a child's family may change, 
          it is still the child's family. These family-centered activities will 
          help develop</p>
        <ul>
          <li> understanding and appreciating of diversity</li>
          <li>art appreciation</li>

        <p>Families come in all shapes, sizes, and forms. Invite the child to 
          draw a family portrait&#151;a picture of all the family members doing something 
          together. When the child has completed the drawing, help label it with 
          each family member's name and a caption that describes what they are 
          doing together. </p>

        <P><b>With a Group: </b><br>
          Prepare a note for parents that describes the activity. For example: 
        </P>
        <blockquote> 
          <p>We're going to make a group family quilt, and we'd like your help. 
            Please help your child decorate this quilt square to show your family 
            doing something together. You might make a drawing or painting, or 
            a collage using cutouts from magazines. We'd like to have all the 
            squares ready by [date]. Thanks for your help! </p>
        </blockquote>
        <P>Send the notes home with a square of construction paper for each family. 
          When the children return the squares, create a group family quilt by 
          lacing the squares together or gluing them onto a large piece of poster 
          paper.</P>
