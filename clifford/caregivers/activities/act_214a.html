            <p>Vaz gets a new satellite dish with 362 channels and begins to loose himself to the world of TV.  He stops participating in activities like reading books, visiting the library and playing soccer.  Eventually, Clifford and his friends help him realize that he's missing out on some very fun and important real life situations.</p>

              Big Idea: </font>Have Respect</h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p><b>Objective:</b><br>        As children grow, it's important that they understand the responsibilities that they have to themselves and others.  Even at young ages, children can practice and comprehend responsibility, often learned by experience and observation.  The following activities nurture:</p>        <ul>          <li>social and emotional skills</li>          <li>reading and language</li>  <li>critical thinking</li>   </ul>      </blockquote>      
            <h3><a name="target"></a><img src="bullet_obone2.gif" width="60" height="28" align="texttop"> 
              <font color="#FF6600">Target Practice! </font></h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p>Materials: Paper target pattern, markers
</p><p>
There's something exciting about hitting the Bull's-eye on a target!  In this fun activity, goals (instead of darts) earn your child the prize for hitting the Bull's-eye.  
</p><p>
Discuss the benefits of being responsible by doing simple chores around the house, yard and neighborhood.  It might be making a bed, raking up leaves, or setting the table for dinner.  
</p><p>
Have your child write a specific goal on each ring of the target pattern.  Then guide your child in choosing an appropriate reward for goals accomplished.  With a marker, write reward or glue a picture of the reward right in the Bull's-eye.  Begin with the outside ring and work inward performing each goal over a week's time.  As each goal is accomplished, color that ring and move to the next goal.  When your child hits the Bull's-eye, it's time for a well-deserved reward!


</p>        <p><b>With a Group:</b> <br>    Engage children in a discussion to come up with some collective goals for the group to accomplish.  These might be community goals like donating some time at the library, visiting a local nursing home or growing a neighborhood garden.</p>      </blockquote>      
            <h3><a name="operation"></a><img src="bullet_pbone2.gif" width="60" height="28" align="texttop"> 
              <font color="#6666CC">Operation Cooperation!</font></h3>      
            <blockquote>   <p>Materials: slips of paper with possible real-life situations for discussion
</p><p>
To begin, discuss the importance of sharing responsibilities.  Name some common responsibilities that different kinds of people might have- firefighters, teachers, zookeepers, policeman/woman, mothers, fathers, etc.  Present some simple real-life situations (such as a Policeman who comes across a child who is alone at the mall.  What is it his responsibility to do?).  Discuss ways that people act responsibly to accomplish a goal or solve challenges.  Use this time to give common sense suggestions on how sharing responsibilities can benefit everyone!  

</p>     <!--[[p]][[b]]With a Group:[[/b]] [[br]]     The activity of bird watching is called "birding."  Arrange for your local bird watching expert to take your group on a birding adventure in the park or zoo.  Encourage children to keep a journal with illustrations to share later.[[/p]]      --></blockquote></td>
