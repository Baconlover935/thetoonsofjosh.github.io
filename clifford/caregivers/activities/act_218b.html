The following activities nurture: 
 </p>        <ul>          <li>social and emotional skills</li>          <li>physical and motor skills</li> <li>health and safety</li>          <li>reading and language</li> </ul>      </blockquote>

            <blockquote>        <p>Materials: playground equipment, balls, 2 small jars or food cans, scissors, magazines 
</p><p>
Discuss playground safety with your child.  Exchange ideas on how friends can be considerate of each other when they play.  Then put those good ideas into action by playing fun games in the park or on your local school playground.  Encourage your child to invite a friend to join in on the fun and playful learning.
<ol>
<li> Slides and Stairs- Introduce the concepts of "up and down." Climb up the ladder steps and slide down the slide!  Encourage your child to count the rungs of the slide ladder forward and backward to reinforce counting.  Remind your child to use directional words "up" and "down" as he/she plays.</li>
<li> Up and Down Walk- As you take a walk, look for things that are up in the sky and down on the ground.  It's a fun way to play "I Spy!"</li>
<li> Use balls to roll down the sidewalk, stairs or lawn.  Then use the balls to roll up these same areas.  Encourage your child to use directional words during play.</li>
<li> Find pictures in a magazine that depict things that are "up" and "down."  Cut out the pictures and place each category in small jars or food cans labeled "up" and "down."  </li>
</ol>

Let's talk about how to be considerate and how being more considerate might have helped Goldilocks!

Read this well-loved story to your child.  Then encourage your child retell the story by interpreting the illustrations.  Discuss the ways in which Goldilocks could have been more considerate to when she visited the bears.  To add to the learning, discuss proper table manners, how to make a bed, and why we should never enter someone else's home without permission!  

 
 </p>    <!-- [[p]][[b]]With a Group:[[/b]] [[br]]     Take your child on a journey to the zoo to discover how animals live with their own kind and among other species in harmony.  Encourage your child to take pictures.  Then use the pictures to create a pictorial diary or book of memories.  Discuss valuable lessons that are observed in the animal habitat.

              <font color="#669933"> Family Jobs</font></h3>      
            <blockquote>       
<p>Materials: 7 Popsicle sticks (one for each day of the week), markers, small magnets, glue, construction paper
</p><p>
Learning to respect the many things that family has to do to keep a household running is an important discovery for a child.  Help your child participate in family responsibilities by using refrigerator magnets made from Popsicle sticks to remind them of daily chores.
</p>
              <p> Cut out small flower petals and a round center and glue together 
                to form a flower at the top of each stick. After deciding on a 
                chore for each day of the week, write the chore on the stem (stick) 
                of the flower. Glue the magnet on the back and place each flower 
                magnet on the refrigerator. As your child performs each daily 
                chore, move the stick to another area of the refrigerator door. 
                When all the magnets have been moved, reward your child for showing 
                the family respect by helping with chores and for a job well done!
