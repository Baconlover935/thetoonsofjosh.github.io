              <p><b>Objective:<br>

                </b>Becoming a responsible person begins early in life. Children 

                are inspired to be responsible and serve others as they recognize 

                compassion and experience the rewards of service to others. The 

                following activities nurture:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>life skills

<li>social and emotional skills



        </ul>

            <blockquote> 

              <p> Look through magazines, news sources, and family pictures to 

                find examples of people and animals helping one other and being 

                responsible. Find out how your child values being a helper, being 

                responsible. Talk about situations that friends, family, and community 

                workers can help others and be responsible. Start a &quot;Great 

                Good Deeds&quot; collage by cutting out pictures and creating 

                personal illustrations to glue on poster board as a reminder of 

                how important doing something for someone else really is! </p>

            <blockquote> 

              <p>Discuss ways that you and your child are compassionate beings. 

                To help your child experience the rewards of being compassionate 

                and responsible, brainstorm on ways that your family could serve 

                a friend, neighbor, family member, or community project. To accomplish 

                this mission, get started by using these ideas:</p>

				<ul><li>

				Spend time with an elderly person.

<li>Ask a neighbor what you can do to help them around their home.

<li>Offer to feed a pet or collect mail while a friend is out of town.

<li>Recycle and encourage family and friends to recycle.

<li>Contact local Guide Dog (Seeing Eye Dog) organization and discover how your family can volunteer to raise a Guide Dog puppy until it is old enough to train for service.
