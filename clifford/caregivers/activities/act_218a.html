            <p>Charley promises to teach Emily Elizabeth how to fish, then keeps putting it off until "tomorrow."  At first, Emily Elizabeth is understanding and uses the extra time to visit the library and check out books on fishing.  But after a while, she's hurt by Charley's continuous cancellations.  Emily Elizabeth and Jetta help him to realize that once a promise is made, it should be honored and respected.</p>

            <blockquote>        <p><b>Objective:</b><br>        Children are most likely to show the same respect for others that they experience in their own lives.  By giving children the opportunity to discover sea life, they can develop greater respect for the sea and it's inhabitants.  The following activities nurture: </p>        <ul>          <li>math and numbers</li>          <li>reading and language</li>  <li>physical and motor skills</li>   </ul>      </blockquote>

            <blockquote>        <p>Materials: Pictures of seasonal clothing, 4 paper plates, glue, scissors
</p><p>
Materials: Illustrated fish book, fish cookie cutter for pattern, paper for 6 fish, crayons, 6 small goldfish bowls or clear drinking glasses
</p><p>
Fish come in every size, shape and color!  Study the many fascinating fish in your child's favorite sea life book.  Then transfer these unique images as you trace, cut out and color fish to count.  Then have fun helping your child play and learn number concepts with these fun games:
<ol>
<li> Use six small goldfish bowls or glasses.  Label each fish and bowl with the numbers 1-6.  Using the cut out goldfish, encourage your child to match each fish to the matching bowl.</li>
<li> Place a different number of fish in two different bowls.  Encourage your child to guess the correct amount.  Change the amounts and try again.</li>
<li> Use three fishbowls to introduce fractions 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3.</li>
<li> Use two fishbowls to introduce counting by twos.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>        <!--[[p]][[b]]With a Group:[[/b]] [[br]]    Engage children in a fun game of seasonal dress up.  The goal is to guess the season that each child has dressed for.  To make it really fun, have a few children mix seasonal dress.  Then wait for someone to catch the mismatched outfits and tell why they are inappropriate for the season.[[/p]] -->     </blockquote>

Take your child on a trip to discover life underwater at your local library, zoo, marine aquarium, etc.  Read about or discover by observation fascinating information about sharks, dolphins, jellyfish and the others incredible kinds of sea life in our oceans.
</p><p>
Help your child identify and cut out (from a magazines or web site printables) a variety of fish/underwater species.  Glue onto both sides of each paper plate.  Connect the paper plates one under the other hooking paperclips into the top and bottom of the middle plate to create a mobile.  Use one more paperclip on the top plate and attach yarn for hanging.
