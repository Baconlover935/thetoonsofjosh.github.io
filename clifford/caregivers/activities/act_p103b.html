              P103b)</font></h3>

            <p>When Clifford realizes how much fun Emily Elizabeth is having in her new club at school, he and the other animals decide to start one of their own, but where will they have their meetings?</p>

              Idea to Grow On: </font>Be a Good Friend</h3>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Objective:<br>

          </b>Being a good friend also means sharing and getting along with others.  By giving children opportunities to play within a small group setting, meaningful experiences can be shared that will build a foundation for growing and enjoying lasting friendships!  The following activities nurture:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>social and emotional skills</li>

          <li>language and literacy skills</li>

		  <li>understanding and appreciating diversity skills</li>

        </ul>

      <blockquote> 

        <p> Make an episode connection by discussing how important it is to include others, especially new or different friends, in playtime.  Encourage your child to invite a friend over to make playdough.  Talk about taking turns and how much fun playing and working together can be.  Use this easy method to help the children take turns making uncooked dough.  Then get creative and make fun objects or impressions for tons of fun and lots of laughter.</p>

		<ul><li>Dough- Mix 3 cups flour with 1/4-cup salt; add 1-cup water with food coloring and 1 T. of oil.  Add more water if too stiff, more flour if too sticky.  Keep dough stored in plastic bags or covered container.     </ul>

      <blockquote> 
<p><b>With a Group:</b><br>
        <p>Hold hands in a circle.  Share with each other why time with friends is so special.  Allow each child to name some special friends, also including pets and friends outside the circle.  After circle activity, allow children to change places and hold hands with another friend.  Sing "You Are My Sunshine" as you slowly walk in a circle for a great transition or closing activity.  </p>
