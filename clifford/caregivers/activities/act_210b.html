            <p>Jetta is certain that camping out is going to be extra boring, so she does her best to bring all the comforts of home along.  But soon, she realizes that there are more ways than one to have a good time and sometimes the simple way is just perfect!</p>

              Big Idea: </font>Work Together</h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p><b>Objective:</b><br>        The best way to learn teamwork and cooperation with others is through experience.  This learning most often occurs through observing and participation and can make a positive impact on a child's ability to interact with others successfully throughout life.  The following activities nurture:</p>        <ul>          <li>social and emotional skills</li>          <li>critical thinking</li><li>creative expression</li><li>health and safety</li>      </ul>      </blockquote>

              <font color="#FF6600">Fun Backyard Camp Out!</font></h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p>Material: tent (be creative! -- sheet, tarp, flattened cardboard box, etc., all make great "tents"), peanut butter and jelly sandwich ingredients, a few simple utensils, musical instruments or homemade instruments- pans and spoons, sticks, beans in a can, favorite book (flashlight for nighttime reading), cup filled with chore assignments
</p><p>
Day or night, this is the perfect campout…no fire, no bears and no fuss!  Encourage your child to be resourceful in building a tent.  Then prepare a delicious PB&J sandwich "al fresco!"  After eating, it's time for some rounds of song and music.  End your fun camp out by reading a favorite book by flashlight or stargazing.  To conclude the camp out, draw chores out of the cup for a fun cleanup! 

   
</p>        <p><b>With a Group:</b> <br>            Teach your group how to sing in a round.  End your fun time by letting everyone draw a chore assignment out of a cup.  By working together, the campsite can be cleaned up and put away, ready for the next fun backyard camp out.</p>      </blockquote>

              <font color="#6666CC">Backyard Maze </font></h3>      
            <blockquote>        <p>Materials: backyard area, common and familiar backyard objects- lawn chair, water hose, planters, landscape, playground equipment, etc. </p>
<p>
Working together is really important, especially when people have to depend on each other to get from one place to another!  Before beginning the maze walk, take a backyard tour.  Discuss common sense reasons for being responsible and keeping objects such as water hoses, gardening tools, planters, playground equipment, lawn furniture, etc., in a proper storage place to avoid potential accidents.  
</p><p>
Discuss the importance of being a good listener and critical thinker before making any quick moves.  Blindfold your child.  Then verbally direct your child from one point to another using directional/position words such as left, right, up, down, around, beside, ahead, behind and counting concepts for navigating distances.  Now it's time for your child to help you navigate through the yard.  Reinforce the common sense reasons for keeping outdoor objects in their proper storage place as you put everything back in it's respective place
</p>     <p><b>With a Group:</b> <br>            Divide friends into pairs.  Have the "navigators" direct the "maze walkers," then switch places and go again.  Time each team and give prizes for the fastest, funniest, and slowest time.  When finished, join together returning backyard objects to their proper storage place. </p>      </blockquote></td>
