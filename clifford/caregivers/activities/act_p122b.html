            <p>Evan and Emily Elizabeth offer to mail a letter for Mr. Solomon on their way to buy tickets to a concert by their favorite band, the Zippers. But the kids' plans are disrupted by their own generosity and helpful nature. When they finally arrive at the park where the concert is taking place, the tickets have been sold out. But the other members of the community are so grateful to the kids for all of their help that day that they all pitch in and make sure that Evan and Emily Elizabeth attend the concert.</p>

                </b>By experiencing the rewards of helping others, children can 
                develop a healthier self-esteem and feeling of worthiness. The 
                following activities nurture: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>social and emotional skills</li>

        <p>Help your child identify pictures of people helping one another.  Categorize both pictures and index cards into helping tasks- inside, outside, with pets, friends, at playtime, and school.  Glue pictures on matching index cards.  Assist your child in writing other things a helper could do on each card.  Record each time your child is a helper.  Set a goal for a sweet treat or reward after participation in each category. </p>

              <p>For an episode connection, read <i>Clifford to the Rescue</i> by Norman 
                Bridwell (Scholastic). Discuss the many ways that Clifford helps 
                others in this story. Engage your child in a conversation about 
                ways to be a helper. Make a refrigerator list of 5 tasks that 
                you and your child could do as partners to help someone else. 
                Then agree on a reward for checking off each task and get busy!</p>
