              Idea to Grow On: </font>Have Respect</h3>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Objective:<br>

          </b>It's quite normal to be apprehensive about meeting someone new, especially someone that appears different!  Learning to appreciate, respect, and understand social diversity is just the beginning of a child's journey to become socially and culturally mature.  The following activities nurture:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>understanding and appreciating diversity skills</li>

          <li>physical and motor skills</li>

		  <li>critical thinking and problem solving skills</li>

        </ul>

      <blockquote> 

        <p> Showing someone new that you appreciate and welcome them is a great way to start a friendship.  Help your child plant a small container with something that will bear fruit or flower with little maintenance.  Make a small flag with the wording "New Friends" or "Welcome!" to stick in the planted pot.  Accompany your child to meet and greet the new neighbor.  After delivering the plant, discuss other ways that you and your child could show others that you welcome and respect them. </p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>Invite your child to help in preparing homemade vegetable soup.  As you add tomatoes, carrots, onions, roast or stew meat, corn, celery, salt, and pepper into soup pot, discuss how these <b>colorful</b> and <b>diverse</b> flavors work together to create delicious soup.  Then encourage your child to think about how this mixture of ingredients compares to the mixture of cultures, making up communities around the world.  What if there were only carrots or onions in the soup?  What if every person was exactly the same?  How would our world be different?  Would it be a better or worse place to live?  Explain that it's the <b>diverse</b>, or <b>different</b>, mixture of people (society) and traditions (culture) that "give flavor" to our world in such an interesting and wonderful way. </p>
