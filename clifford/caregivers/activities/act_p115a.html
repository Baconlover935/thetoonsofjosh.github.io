      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Objective:<br>

          </b>It's important to provide opportunities for children to grow in self-awareness and self-confidence.  By doing this, children can explore their own personality and learn about their own potential.  The following activities nurture:</p>

        <ul>

          <li>social and emotional skills</li>

          <li>language and literacy skills</li>

		  <li>physical and motor skills</li>

        </ul>

      <blockquote> 

        <p> Begin this activity by reading <i>The Mixed Up Chameleon</i> by Eric Carle to your child and a friend.  Encourage children to retell the story and discuss Eric Carle's creative artwork.  Then help your child grow in self-awareness by providing clothes and accessories for a fun dress-up time.  Interact with children and share the fun of pretending and make-believe.   </p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>Read <i>Clifford's First Valentine's Day</i> by Norman Bridwell (Scholastic).  Reinforce your child's fine motor skills by cutting out red, pink, and white hearts to lace or glue on a Valentine's Day collage.  Other items such as rickrack and doilies can also add pizzazz to the collage.  Continue the theme of hearts by baking heart-shaped cookies with colored icing, or making sandwiches with a heart-shaped cookie cutter.  Share collage and treats with a favorite Valentine!        </p>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>With a Group:</b><br>

          Discuss the phrase "broken heart."  Explain to children that hearts don't really break, but that this phrase means that someone is sad or hurting inside about something.  Ask them if they have ever known someone with a broken heart.  Then help the children cut out half as many large heart shapes as you have children (5 shapes for 10 children).  Make sure each heart is cut in half with a distinct pattern.  Mark each half of each heart with the same letter or number.  Pass out the heart pieces and let children move about matching their broken hearts.  When the pieces fit together, the broken heart is mended and celebrated with a hug!
