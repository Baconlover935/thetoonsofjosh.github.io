        <p><b>Objective:<br>
          </b>The process of learning to be truthful and honest begins early in life.  Fun learning opportunities can help develop a sense of fact and fiction while positively reinforcing how important it is to tell the truth.  The following activities nurture:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> critical thinking and problem solving skills</li>
          <li> social and emotional skills</li>
		  <li> language and literacy skills</li>

              <p>Choose a favorite fiction or fantasy story to read to your child.  Discuss the reality of the characters, animals, setting, and events that took place in the story.
