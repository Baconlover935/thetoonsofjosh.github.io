            <p>Emily Elizabeth tells Nina that she still sleeps with her baby 
              blanket. Later, Nina inadvertently shares this information with 
              Shun. Soon, everyone knows about Emily Elizabeth's &quot;blanky.&quot; 
              When she discovers this, Emily Elizabeth is upset with Nina, but 
              Nina doesn't understand why she should apologize when Emily Elizabeth 
              never explicitly told her that this information was a secret. With 
              Evan's help, Nina learns that confidences between friends really 
              shouldn't be broken and she apologizes to Emily Elizabeth.</p>

              Ideas to Grow On: </font>Be a Good Friend</h3>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Objective:<br>

          </b>It's important for children to learn how to show respect for others.  Children grow to understand the value of respect by having positive, teachable experiences as they interact with family and friends.  The following activities nurture: </p>

        <ul>

          <li>language and literacy skills</li>

          <li>critical thinking and problem solving skills</li>

		  <li>social and emotional skills </li>

        </ul>

      </blockquote>

            <h3><a name="promise"></a><img src="bullet_obone2.gif" width="60" height="28" align="texttop" alt="A Promise is a Promise is a Promise"><font color="#FF6600">A Promise is a Promise is a Promise!
			</font></h3>

      <blockquote> 

        <p>Every friend knows how important it is to keep a promise.  Help your child appreciate the importance of keeping a promise by sharing in these fun activities:
		<ul>

		        <li>Read: <i>The Flag We Love </i>by Pam Munoz Ryan (Charlesbridge) 
                  and <i>Red, White & Blue: The Story of the American Flag </i>(All 
                  Aboard Reading Level 2) by John Herman (Gosset & Dunlap). Practice showing respect to the American flag by standing at attention 
                  and placing hand over heart when the pledge is spoken or the 
                  flag passes by. 
                <li>Turn an old deck of cards into a new "deck of promises."  Paint cards.  Write simple promises with marker on each card.  Take turns drawing from the deck each week.  Keeping simple promises like picking up toys, helping in the kitchen, or reading 15 minutes each day, can help a child grow into those bigger promises that come along later in life.
		</ul>

      </blockquote>

            <h3><a name="group"></a><img src="bullet_pbone2.gif" width="60" height="28" align="texttop" alt="Group Promise"><font color="#6666CC">Group Promise!</font></h3>

      <blockquote> 
<p><b>With a Group:</b><br>
        Help children choose a community organization or service project to participate in on a routine basis.  Create a simple contract for each child to sign as a commitment, or promise, to keep.  Set a reward for the entire group to enjoy together when they have fulfilled their commitments.</p>
