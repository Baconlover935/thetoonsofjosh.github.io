            <p>It's Wacky Wednesday at school. Emily Elizabeth and her friends are excited to spend the day telling jokes and having fun. Nina, however, goes too far with the day. In the end she realizes that her behavior wasn't respectful of her friends and that there is an appropriate time and place for certain behaviors.</p>

              Ideas to Grow On: </font>Have Respect</h3>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Objective:<br>

          </b>Children have a great sense of humor…and joking around is lots of fun, unless feelings become hurt.  Helping children become aware of what's respectful and what's not respectful while sharing humor can help friends better appreciate one another's differences and feelings.  The following activities nurture: </p>

        <ul>

          <li>social and emotional skills

          <li>language and literacy skills

		  <li>understanding and appreciating diversity skills
		  
		  <li>physical and emotional skills

        </ul>
