            <p>Evan, Emily Elizabeth and Clifford all help out at the Adopt-A-Pup booth at the neighborhood street fair. Clifford befriends a teacup poodle named Bon Bon, a tiny dog who is barely bigger than he is, and helps her find a home.</p>

              Ideas to Grow On: </font>Be Kind</h3>

      <blockquote> 

        <p><b>Objective:<br>

          </b>Children are naturally kind-hearted!  By taking care of a dog, or any kind of pet, children can share their kindness and learn responsibility.  The following activities nurture: </p>

        <ul>

          <li>social and emotional skills</li>

          <li>understanding and appreciating diversity skills</li>

		  <li>language and literacy skills</li>

        </ul>

        <p>Have fun helping your child learn all about dogs by using these dog facts  </p>

		<ul>

<li>Dogs range in size from four-pound teacup poodles to the world's tallest dog, the Irish wolfhound, nearly 3 ft. tall

<li>Smaller dogs tend to live longer than larger ones.

<li>There are more than 400 breeds of dogs.

<li>Experts say that dogs were bred to be friendly companions between 12,000 and 25,000 years ago.

<li>Dogs are omnivores, needing a diet of meats and vegetables to stay healthy.

<li>Dairy products can make dogs sick.

<li>Tail sniffing is like shaking hands for people!

<li>Basenjis are the only dogs that don't bark.  They yodel!

<li>A dog's nose can detect odors about a billion times better than humans can!

		</ul>

		      <ul>

                <li>Encourage your child to draw a picture of the family dog or pet.  Assist your child in writing a description identifying size, color, bark, and breed features like a long tail, short snout, or floppy ears, etc.  

                <li>Record special times with your child and the family dog with 
                  camera or video.

      <blockquote> 

              <p><b>With a Group:</b><br>

         Introduce group to these dog-gone common sense ideas for dog care:</p>
		 
		 <ul>
		 <li>No-no's for dogs- chocolate, sharp or small bones, milk or dairy products
		 <li>Don't ever wake a dog up suddenly.  He might bite!
		 <li>Keep cleaning fluids, paint, and other chemicals out of reach!  Common plants like azaleas, lilies, English ivy, and rhododendron can make dogs sick.
		 <li>If an inside accident occurs, clean it up promptly or the dog is likely to return to that same spot for another try!
		 <li>Outside dogs need plenty of shade and water in the hot months and a warm, dry shelter during cold times of the year.
		 <li>Dogs that get attention and exercise are less likely to be naughty chewers.
		 <li>Check once a week for bumps, lumps, flakes and scabs.  Flea dirt looks like tiny specs of black pepper.
		 <li>A bath every month or so will do, but get all that soap washed out!
		 </ul>
