          <IMG SRC="../../images/spacer.gif" WIDTH=1 HEIGHT=8 BORDER=0><BR>
          HINTS: Ask the child what Clifford wants to do. What would help him 
          eat his dinner? Why would each of the other things NOT help? You may 
          want to explain that incorrect choices are not foods; they aren't things 
          that Clifford could eat. The correct choice is something that Clifford 
          could eat. Extend the activity offline by discussing things that the 
          child can do to help prepare or serve a meal. <BR>
          <BR>
          <B>...When It Rains</B><BR>
          HINTS: Ask the child what is happening in the picture. What would someone 
          need when rain is falling? What item would help Clifford most? You may 
          want to explain that incorrect choices would not help Clifford in a 
          rainstorm; they may be things that he would like to have, but they're 
          not things that he would need. Extend the activity offline by asking 
          "How can you help me in the kitchen (or other area of the home)?" and 
          "How can I help you?" <BR>
          <B><BR>
          ...Play Ball at the Beach </B><BR>
          HINTS: Ask the child what is happening in the picture. What would someone 
          need to have fun at the beach? What item would Clifford and his friends 
          want most? You may want to explain that incorrect choices are not things 
          that a person would want or need at the beach. Ask the child to explain 
          (or explain to the child) where and when those objects would be useful. 
          Extend the activity offline by asking "What would you give Clifford 
          to help him have fun in the snow (or other situation)?" </FONT></P>

          Warm<BR>
          </B>HINTS: (Games marked + are more challenging.) Ask the child what 
          is happening in the picture. What would someone need to stay warm on 
          a cold winter day? What things would help Clifford most? Discuss the 
          reasons why the incorrect choices would not help Clifford stay warm. 
          (He couldn't play tennis or ride a bike in the snow or swim in a pool 
          in cold weather, and a frog might keep him company but couldn't help 
          him stay warm.) Extend the activity offline by asking "What else helps 
          us stay warm on a cold day?" and "How do we cool off on a hot day?"

          . Paint the Fence<BR>
          </B>HINTS: (Games marked + are more challenging.) Ask the child what 
          Clifford wants to do. What would help him paint the fence? Why would 
          each of the other things NOT help? (The camera and lawn mower are tools 
          for other jobs. What jobs are they for? The easel is a tool for a different 
          kind of painting. When would Clifford use an easel? Clifford might like 
          to have the hot dog as a snack, but it wouldn't help him paint the fence!) 
          Extend the activity offline by helping the child paint one of the printable 
          pictures on Clifford's site. </FONT></P>

          . Take a Bath<BR>
          </B>HINTS: (Games marked + are more challenging.) Ask the child what 
          is happening in the picture. What would someone need to take a bath? 
          What items would help Clifford? Discuss why each of the other things 
          would NOT help Clifford. (They would be useful in doing other things, 
          but not in taking a bath. The wheelbarrow and rake would help Clifford 
          work in the garden. The stepladder would help someone reach a high place-but 
          Clifford wouldn't need it! The box of tools would help Clifford do many 
          jobs around the house, but they wouldn't help him take a bath.) Extend 
          the activity offline by asking "What toys do you think Clifford likes 
          to take into the bath with him?" </FONT></P>
        <P><font face="Comic Sans MS, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif" size="2"><b>CLIFFORD KISSES</b><br>
          HINTS: Explain that T-Bone has a way to make sure that everyone gets a big kiss from Clifford. He wants to make sure that they all take turns.  Ask what T-Bone is holding in his mouth.  What color is it?  Who has a balloon the same color as T-Bone's?  That person gets the next Clifford kiss!  Extend the game offline by matching pairs of items to take turns in any home activity or, with a group of children, use matching items to take turns in a game.</font></P>
        <p><font face="Comic Sans MS, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif" size="2"><b>A CLIFFORD SLIDE</b><br>
          HINTS: Explain that Emily Elizabeth has a way to make sure that everyone gets a chance to slide down Clifford's back. She wants to make sure that they all take turns.  Point out the character who is waiting to take a turn. Ask what color bathing suit and towel the character has. </font><font face="Comic Sans MS, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif" size="2">Which inner tube is the same color?  The character needs that inner tube to slide down Clifford's back and splash into the water.

          HINTS: Ask the child what is happening in the picture. Ask for interpretations 
          and predictions. Why are the dogs making piles of leaves? Who will make 
          the biggest pile? What will happen next? After the picture changes,

          HINTS: Talk with the child about what it means to make a promise. If 
          someone makes a promise to you, do you expect the person to keep it?

          HINTS: How do you think Clifford felt when he saw T-Bone's leaves blow

          Clifford and Cleo alike? How are they different? How about Clifford 
          and Emily Elizabeth? You may want to explain why incorrect choices are 
          incorrect, based on the concepts of size and appropriate living conditions. 
          Clifford could not fit into any of the rooms in Emily Elizabeth's house; 
          they would be too small for him. Clifford couldn't even fit his head 
          into T-Bone's house! T-Bone wouldn't live in Emily Elizabeth's house 
          because he's the Sheriff's dog; he has a house of his own in the Sheriff's 
          yard. T-Bone would find Clifford's house much too big for him; he'd 
          be "rattling around" in it. Emily Elizabeth wouldn't want to live in 
          a dog house . . . because she's not a dog! When the child clicks the 
          right house, he or she will be able to print a cut-out to color and 
          assemble offline. </FONT></P>

          </B>HINTS: Help the child look for clues in the pictures that lead to 
          the correct answer. Which shop has bread in the window and other foods 
          that are like bread? Which shop has eyeglasses in the window? Where 
          else do you see eyeglasses at that shop? Which shop has pictures of 
          dogs that have had a bath? You may want to explain why incorrect choices 
          are incorrect, based on the concepts of similarities and differences. 
          Bread, rolls, cookies, and cake are alike because they are all foods, 
          all made from flour, and all baked-but bread is very different from 
          eyeglasses and dogs. All eyeglasses are alike in that they help people 
          see better, even though they may be different sizes, colors, shapes, 
          or strengths&#151;but eyeglasses are very different from bread and dogs. 
          Every dog is unique, but after a bath all dogs are alike in being clean-and 
          dogs are very different from bread and eyeglasses. When the child clicks 
          the right building, he or she will be able to print a cut-out to color 
          and assemble offline. </FONT></P>

        As you explore this area with a child, ask questions that will help to 
        focus the child's attention on the details in each area, such as: What 
        do you think is happening here? What are the people doing? Why are they 
        doing that? Read the cast biographies to the child and ask a question 
        or two to check the child's comprehension as you read each one. For example, 
        you might ask: What other voices has John Ritter performed besides Clifford's?
