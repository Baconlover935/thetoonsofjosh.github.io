          Help the child look for clues in the pictures that lead to the correct 
          answer. Which shop has bread in the window and other foods that are 
          like bread? Which shop has eyeglasses in the window? Where else do you 
          see eyeglasses at that shop? Which shop has pictures of dogs that have 
          had a bath?</FONT></p>
        <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif" SIZE="2">You may 
          want to explain why incorrect choices are incorrect, based on the concepts 
          of similarities and differences. Bread, rolls, cookies, and cake are 
          alike because they are all foods, all made from flour, and all baked-but 
          bread is very different from eyeglasses and dogs. All eyeglasses are 
          alike in that they help people see better, even though they may be different 
          sizes, colors, shapes, or strengths&#151;but eyeglasses are very different 
          from bread and dogs. Every dog is unique, but after a bath all dogs 
          are alike in being clean-and dogs are very different from bread and 
          eyeglasses. When the child clicks the right building, he or she will 
          be able to print a cut-out to color and assemble offline. <BR>
