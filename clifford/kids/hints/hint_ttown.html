          Remind the child that people (and dogs) are different from one another. 
          Which house belongs to Clifford? To Emily Elizabeth? To Cleo? How are 
          Clifford and Cleo alike? How are they different? How about Clifford 
          and Emily Elizabeth?</FONT></p>
        <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif" SIZE="2"> You may 
          want to explain why incorrect choices are incorrect, based on the concepts 
          of size and appropriate living conditions. Clifford could not fit into 
          any of the rooms in Emily Elizabeth's house; they would be too small 
          for him. Clifford couldn't even fit his head into T-Bone's house! T-Bone 
          wouldn't live in Emily Elizabeth's house because he's the Sheriff's 
          dog; he has a house of his own in the Sheriff's yard. T-Bone would find 
          Clifford's house much too big for him; he'd be &quot;rattling around&quot; 
          in it. Emily Elizabeth wouldn't want to live in a dog house . . . because 
          she's not a dog!</FONT></p>
        <p><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif" SIZE="2"> When 
          the child clicks the right house, he or she will be able to print a 
          cut-out to color and assemble offline.<BR>
