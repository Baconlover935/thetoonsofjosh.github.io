      <h4>Before You Begin</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Click on the thumbnails below to print out the cards. There are CHARACTER cards that show characters holding a card with an object on it, and there are OBJECT cards which have the matching objects on them.  SIMPLER cards have shapes to match, MORE CHALLENGING cards have objects/props to match.  <br>
        Have the child color the cards. Then cut them out along the dotted lines.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Game 1: Simple Matching</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Object of the game: Find the correct matches for each pair of cards. </p>
        <p>Spread all the cards out on a table, face up. Select both cards in one pair, for example the OBJECT card with the circle on it and the CHARACTER card that shows Mac holding a circle card.  Explain why the cards match; for example, say, &quot;This card has a circle on it. And this card shows Mac holding a card with a circle on it. So these cards match.&quot; Set the pair aside and ask the child to find another pair of cards that match. Continue until all the cards have been matched.</p>
        <p><b>For very young children:</b> Use only one set of cards.<br>
        <b>With a group:</b> Have children take turns matching cards.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Game 2: Draw and Match</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Distribute the CHARACTER cards equally between you and the child, placing them face up in front of you. Put the OBJECT cards face down in a stack. Draw cards from the stack one by one and ask, &quot;Who has a match for the [balloon]?&quot;  The player who has the matching character card gets the object card and puts the pair aside.</p>
        <p><b>For very young children:</b> Use only one set of cards.<br>
        <b>With a group:</b> Distribute the cards equally among all the children.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Game 3: Memory or Concentration</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Place all cards face down in the middle of the table. Mix them well and arrange them in rows. Taking turns, each player should choose two cards and turn them face up so that all players can see them. If they match, the player may keep them and take another turn. If they do not match, the player should turn them face down again in the same locations. The player with the most matching pairs wins.</p>
        <p><b>For very young children:</b> Use only one set of cards.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h4>Game 4: Rummy</h4>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Distribute the CHARACTER cards equally among the players. Place the OBJECT cards face down in a stack in the middle of the table. Taking turns, each player should choose one object card from the stack. If the player has a matching character card, he or she can put the two cards together and keep the matched pair. If the player does not have a matching character card, he or she must put the card back on the stack. Then the next player takes a turn. The first player to match all of his or her character cards wins.</p>
        <p><b>For very young children:</b> Use only one set of cards.<br>
        <b>To have everyone win:</b> Continue playing until all the cards have been matched.</p>
